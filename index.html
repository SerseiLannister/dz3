      <p>9 MICHELIN-starred restaurants in the first edition of the MICHELIN Guide dedicated to the capital of Russia ; 3 MICHELIN Green Stars awarded to local Chefs paving the way for sustainable gastronomy.</p>
      <p>The long-awaited arrival of the MICHELIN Guide marks a recognition of the rapid development in gastronomic culture in Russia over the past 30 years. The unique history and traditions of the region, formed by the variety of high-quality local products from the Far East, the Altai Republic, the Black Sea and the north-west of Russia, inspire talented chefs to create exquisite culinary masterpieces that cannot be found anywhere else.</p>
      <p>The first ever Moscow MICHELIN Star ceremony took place tonight, at the Zaryadye Concert Hall, in the heart of the Russian capital. The festive evening, organized with all necessary security measures, was attended by more than 500 guests.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;<em>The MICHELIN Guide and Moscow are sharing a historical moment with the unveiling of the&nbsp;<a href="https://guide.michelin.com/en/ru/restaurants" target="_blank">MICHELIN Guide Moscow 2022 selection</a>. Inspectors have been particularly seduced by the high-quality local produce. Russia is a wonderfully wide-ranging expression of nature: from sea coasts to wild forests, from aromatic herbs to first-class seafood&hellip; There are lots of discoveries to make</em>&rdquo; says Gwendal Poullennec, MICHELIN Guide International Director. &ldquo;<em>Moreover, thanks to cultural exchanges throughout history between Russia and Europe, Central Asia and the Middle East, gourmets will experience unforgettable authentic meals full of flavor</em>.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Restaurants were celebrated through the announcement of the MICHELIN Guide selection, with the reveal of&nbsp;<strong>Bib Gourmand</strong>&nbsp;(for restaurants offering particularly interesting value for money, where you can enjoy a delicious meal under RUB2000),&nbsp;<strong>MICHELIN Stars</strong>&nbsp;(for restaurants serving high-quality cuisine), and&nbsp;<strong>MICHELIN Green Stars</strong>&nbsp;(for restaurants that are pioneering in their sustainable approach).</p>
      <p>As for all its other selections, the MICHELIN Guide has used the same historical methodology. The team of independent and anonymous inspectors from the Guide has been in the field for its traditional table-tests, during which they evaluate the meal they experience via&nbsp;<strong>5 assessment criteria&nbsp;</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The quality of the produce used</li>
      <li>The mastery of cooking techniques</li>
      <li>The mastery of flavors</li>
      <li>The chef&rsquo;s personality in his/her cuisine</li>
      <li>The consistency between visits</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Thanks to the seriousness and depth of their methodology, inspectors were able to collectively build this first MICHELIN Guide Moscow selection.</p>
